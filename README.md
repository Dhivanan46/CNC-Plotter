# CNC-Plotter

The current research deals with the utilization of the E-waste to generate a product efficient in mechanical activities such as  sheet cutting, wood cutting, welding, and thermocol cutting using Arduino microcontroller based on Computer Numerical controller  (CNC) machine. The machine is versatile in the way, as just by changing the tool mechanical activities associated with the device can be  changed .The aim in developing the machine is the minimization of E-waste which is the need of an hour. This machine is assembled by  using wastes such as DVD drives, Drive cabinets, old scooter battery etc. which reduces its manufacturing cost. This device is one of its kind and surely find its vast use in industries dealing with precise automated cutting and welding.
